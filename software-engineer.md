Use Mathesar’s open source and web-based interface to give your team **direct access to Postgres**. No technical skills required.

Now you can spend **less time** creating custom reports and manually updating data.

You can ensure data integrity. Perform quick
schema changes. And let teammates create reports – without depending on you.

Mathesar doesn’t have its own set of abstractions so it won’t make unexpected changes to your database.

{% capture capture_1 %}
Mathesar uses and manipulates Postgres **schemas, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints and data types**.

So any configuration you do in the UI will **reflect directly in your Postgres databases**.
Nothing will prevent you from working with the same data in other tools outside of Mathesar.

All the same **data integrity safeguards** you set up via the Mathesar UI will still apply.

**Proprietary products** can keep you locked in their ecosystem. This can make it **difficult to integrate or migrate your disparate data sources**.

If you decide to move away, you could lose data.

Mathesar is **self-hosted** – giving you **full control over your system and your data**. You can integrate with other Postgres-friendly tools.

{% capture capture_3 %}
**Non-technical people** often struggle to work with normalized data. Even **database-spreadsheet hybrid applications complicate the normalization process**.

Mathesar creates and reflects relationships at the database level.  There are no **“relationship column types”** and there are no **abstractions**.

Mathesar uses **actual foreign key constraints** and provides a UI to understand links easily – no technical skills required.

Your colleagues can use Mathesar’s interface to answer their **ad-hoc questions** quickly.

This can **reduce the need for you** to create custom reports and update data manually.

Mathesar is **free, licensed under GPLv3**. There are **no paid plans**.

Although we’re new, we already have **dozens of contributors**. If you’re interested, **you can also contribute**.

**We work in public** – you can check out what our team is doing on [GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar) and [Matrix](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/matrix). And via our [mailing lists](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/mailing-lists).

Manually changing your schema can require **hours of rote work** or custom code.
This can lead to disruptions – like **downtime**, **stale data** and difficulties in meeting your SLA.

Mathesar makes schema and data migrations a one-click solution.
There are **no disruptions** – which can help **ease your data integration workflow**.

Database joins can be confusing for non-technical users to fully understand.

With Mathesar’s Data Explorer, your **collaborators don’t need to understand joins**. They can see and use relationships between data – with the joins happening behind the scenes.

**Anyone can build a query through the UI** that displays data from across **multiple tables**.

This can remove the dependency layer on you and allow for more exploration into your database.

### You and your collaborators can quickly enter data. View it. Slice it.

#### Move data around. Transform and filter it.

While still retaining structure and consistency.

{% capture quote %}
"At my previous job, business experts relied on me to **create reports** for them, every single day.

But shouldn’t developers be focusing more on **supporting technical infrastructure**? Isn’t that our main function?

With Mathesar, they would have had the tools to generate their own reports, allowing developers to focus on what we do best."
