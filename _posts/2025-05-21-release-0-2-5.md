This is a minor hotfix release that fixes a single regression introduced by Mathesar [0.2.4](./2025-05-19-release-0-2-4.md). Access to the Data Explorer has been restored for Postgres databases that are connected via TCP/IP.

Please see the [0.2.5](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.2.5/) release notes for full details and installation instructions.

### Data explorer access restored for all connections

Mathesar [0.2.4](./2025-05-19-release-0-2-4.md) introduced a bug where the Data Explorer was showing an error unless the underlying Postgres database was configured to connect via Unix socket. This change restores full Data Explorer functionality, regardless of database connection type.
