Mathesar 0.7.0 is here! This release introduces **CSV imports into existing tables**, allowing you to bring data into your existing Mathesar tables more easily. You can now also **export results from data explorations** and **upload files directly in forms**.

Other highlights in this release:

- **📊 Export data exploration results:** Export explorations as CSV files for sharing or analysis outside of Mathesar.
- **📎 File uploads in forms:** Forms now support uploading files, enabling richer submissions from users.
- **🎯 Improved cell context menus:** Redesigned context menus better support multi-selection and more efficient actions.
- **⚡ Faster imports:** Optimized numeric and money imports are now significantly faster.

And of course, many other fixes and enhancements. Read [our full release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.7.0/) for more information.

### 📥 Import CSV data into existing tables

You can now import CSV files directly into an existing Mathesar table. Headers are automatically matched to column names where possible, and you can map any remaining columns manually. You are also able to specify whether the CSV contains a header row.

### 📊 Export data exploration results

Explorations can now be exported as CSV files via an "export" button in the top right corner of the exploration view, allowing you to share or analyze query results outside of Mathesar.

### 📎 File uploads in forms

Forms now support uploading files, enabling richer submissions from users. Uploaded files are previewable directly within the form interface.

To enable this feature:

- [Configure your file storage backend](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/administration/file-backend-config/)
- (optional) Set a global maximum file size for anonymous uploads

### 🎯 Improved cell context menus

Right-click context menus have been redesigned to better support multi-selection and more efficient actions. You can now select and delete multiple rows at once, and actions are organized into submenus for easier navigation and future expansion.

### ⚡ Faster numeric and money imports

Importing large CSV or TSV files with numeric or money columns is now significantly faster. Mathesar now uses optimized casting functions for these types during import, cutting processing times dramatically—up to 97% faster in internal benchmarks for large datasets (500K rows).

### 🐘 PostgreSQL 18 support

Mathesar now supports the latest version of PostgreSQL, version 18, released on September 25th.
