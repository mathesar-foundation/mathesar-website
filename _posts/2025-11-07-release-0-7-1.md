Mathesar 0.7.1 is here! This release fixes a **critical bug that prevented casting database column types** from one type to another. This bug most impacted CSV imports, particularly when importing data into new tables or when Mathesar's type inference system needed to adjust column types during the import process. The bug could also affect manual column type changes in existing tables.

Read [our full release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.7.1/) for more information.

### 🐛 Fix column type casting regression

A regression introduced in 0.7.0 caused failures when casting columns between certain database types, particularly when converting between numeric and money types. The casting function was incorrectly applying currency-related formatting options (like currency prefixes and suffixes) to numeric columns that don't support them, and was not properly handling cases where cast options were empty or not applicable to the target type.

### 📚 Documentation updates

- Updated the URL to Mathesar's Railway 1-click deployment template

### ⚠️ Upcoming changes in 0.8.0

Mathesar's 0.8.0 release will end official support for PostgreSQL 13 and Python 3.9. We recommend upgrading these dependencies prior to installing 0.8.0 to ensure continued compatibility and support.

While Mathesar is likely to function with older versions, compatibility is no longer tested, and assistance cannot be provided for issues encountered on unsupported versions.
