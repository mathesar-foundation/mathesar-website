This release contains targeted fixes for bugs within Mathesar's new [UNIX socket connection](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.2.3/#more-options-for-internal-database-connections) feature, as released in version 0.2.3.

Visit the [0.2.4](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.2.4/) release notes for full details and installation instructions.

### Unix socket bug fixes

In version 0.2.3, users experienced the following issues when connecting via Unix socket:

- Inability to create new databases when Mathesar's internal database used a Unix socket connection [#4481](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues/4481 "Hotfix for SQLAlchemy connecting to DBs over UNIX sockets").
- Failure to connect when the internal database used a Unix socket connection with an explicit port specified [#4473](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues/4473 "Fix issues related to connections via unix socket").
- Problems working with data explorations whose base tables were connected via Unix socket [#4473](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues/4473 "Fix issues related to connections via unix socket").

These issues have all been resolved. Additionally, Unix socket connections **no longer require URL encoding**. Instead, they must now be provided unencoded:

- ❌ `%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fpostgresql`
- ✅ `/var/run/postgresql`
