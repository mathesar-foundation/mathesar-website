Mathesar 0.5.0 is here! Our biggest new feature is the **form builder**, which allows you to design and share forms and collect data from anyone, directly into your Mathesar database. You can create forms that connect data across multiple tables, choose which fields to include, and control whether you want respondents to be able to create new records.

Other highlights in this release:

- **🪟 Record modals:** You can now view and edit records in a modal without leaving the table page.
- **📝 Prominent column descriptions:** Column descriptions are now accessible via table headers.
- **🔑 Automatic secret key generation:** Installing Mathesar now involves one fewer step.

And of course, many other fixes and enhancements. Read [our full release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.5.0/) for more information.

### 📋 Form builder

You can now build and share forms that collect information from anyone, without giving them access to your Mathesar installation. Each form is linked to a table, and submissions are automatically saved as new records. Forms are shared via a unique link, and anyone with access to the link can submit responses.

You can create forms that connect data across multiple tables, choose which fields to include, and control how related data is handled. Respondents can select from existing records or create new ones on the fly, depending on how you set up the form.

### 🪟 Single record view modal

Single record links in the table page now open a modal instead of a separate page. You can still access the full single record page via a link in the modal. This change aims to make it easier for users to review and edit records without losing context.

### 📝 More prominent column descriptions

Column headers in the table page now show icons when the column has a description. The description is displayed on hover. This eliminates the need to open the Inspector to see column descriptions.

### 🔑 Automatic `SECRET_KEY` generation during install

We've automated generating and persisting the `SECRET_KEY` variable during the Mathesar installation process. You may also provide your own `SECRET_KEY`, which will override the automatically generated one.

This simplifies some installation methods by removing the need for a previously fully manual step. However, you must still supply a `SECRET_KEY` manually when deploying on platforms without a persistent filesystem such as [DigitalOcean's App Platform](../administration/install-digitalocean.md), to ensure stability across restarts.

For our next release, we’re actively working on:

- better support for working with files in Mathesar
- the ability to edit data from multiple tables in a single view
