Mathesar 0.4.0 is here! It introduces support for single sign-on (SSO) using OIDC, DigitalOcean and Railway one-click deployments, and the ability to paste new records directly into Mathesar. The release also includes many smaller enhancements and fixes, such as the ability to view and edit JSON from the UI. 

Please see the [0.4.0 release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.4.0/) for the full list of changes and upgrade instructions.

### 🔒 Initial support for single sign-on (SSO)

Mathesar administrators can now set up single sign-on (SSO) as an authentication mechanism for their users, allowing them to log in without needing separate credentials. Administrators can also restrict access to specific email domains and assign a default database role for new users.

We support any OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider, including Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, Google Workspace, and dozens of others. See our SSO documentation for more information. See [our SSO documentation](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/administration/single-sign-on/) for more information.

### 📦 Bulk creation of records via pasting

You can now bulk-create records within Mathesar’s UI by pasting data into the table page. This feature also allows you to import data into existing Mathesar tables from other sources such as spreadsheets.

Previously, Mathesar’s support for pasting needed existing rows to hold the data. Now, you can paste new data into the placeholder row at the bottom of a table, and Mathesar will create as many new rows as needed. If your pasted content also overlaps existing records, those will be updated as well.

### 🌊 DigitalOcean and 🚂 Railway deployments

We've set up official templates to deploy Mathesar to [DigitalOcean](../administration/install-digitalocean.md) and [Railway](../administration/install-railway.md). These options allow you to set up a Mathesar installation without needing to manage server infrastructure or use the command-line.

### 🧑‍💻 Initial support for JSON in UI

We have added support for viewing and editing JSON and JSONB data in tables, plus displaying the data correctly in the Data Explorer. Previously, JSON data was displayed as `[object Object]` in cells.

### 📋 Record pages use table column order

Previously, pages for individual records listed columns in the order that the database stored them in. Table pages allow columns to be reordered for display, and we've updated record pages to use that same order.

### 🆘 Help us refine forms and files!

For our next release, we’re actively working on better support for **working with files** in Mathesar and the ability to **create forms** (like Google Forms).

If you’re interested in either, we’d love your input! We want to make sure we’re prioritizing the right problems to solve. [Talk to us for 20 min](https://cal.com/mathesar/users), we’ll give you a $25 gift card as a thank you.
