Mathesar 0.8.0 is here! This release introduces the ability to **edit data from multiple related tables in a single place** on the table page. We've also added support for **more precise filtering**, including combining and excluding groups of filters. Additionally, **PostgreSQL views** set up in the database are now automatically displayed in the UI along with tables.

This release also includes usability improvements for smaller screens, a new way to access copy and paste functionality, and support for multiple SSL modes when configuring databases, as well as many other enhancements and bug fixes.

Other highlights in this release:

- **🔍 More precise filtering:** Create complex queries with nested groups using AND/OR/NOT logic.
- **👁️ Database views support:** PostgreSQL views automatically appear in the schema page alongside tables.
- **🔒 Multiple SSL modes:** Configure SSL modes for database connections through the UI or environment variables.
- **📱 Improved touch support:** Better experience on touch-only devices with multi-cell selection.
- **✂️ Copy and paste in context menu:** Copy and paste operations are now available directly from cell context menus.

And of course, many other fixes and enhancements. Read [our full release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.8.0/) for more information.

### 🔗 Extend tables with related data

The table page now has an "Extend" button to display columns from some related tables alongside columns from the current table. Users can also add and remove related data by editing the related data cell.

This feature currently only supports "many to many" relationships via mapping tables that do not have any additional fields other than foreign keys. For instance, `genres` related to `movies` via a `movies_genres` table, or `categories` applied to `support_tickets` via a `ticket_categories` table.

### 🔍 More powerful filtering

Mathesar now supports more flexible filtering options for tables that can use complex logical expressions. You can group related conditions together and then combine those groups to support extremely precise filters.

Previously, Mathesar's filtering only supported either a single `AND` or a single `OR` operation.

### 👁️ Database views support

PostgreSQL views that have been set up in the database now automatically appear in Mathesar. They are displayed on the schema page alongside tables with their own icon and color.

### 🔒 Configurable SSL mode for database connections

We've improved compatibility with more databases in the wild by adding support for multiple SSL modes when configuring connected databases in Mathesar. You can set up the SSL mode for the UI, or use environment variables for local database connections.

### 🔐 Column-level UPDATE privilege support

Mathesar now allows users to edit columns if they have PostgreSQL's column-level `UPDATE` privileges without having table-level `UPDATE` privileges. Previously, we checked for table-level privileges in all cases.

### ✂️ Copy and paste in context menu

![Copy and paste options in the cell context menu](/images/blog/0.8.0/copy-in-context-menu.png)

Mathesar tables now allow users to copy and paste using the cell context menu. This also improves copy/paste support for touch-only devices where keyboard shortcuts aren't available.

### 📱 Improved support for touch-only devices

We've added the ability to select multiple cells in the table page using a new context menu option. Additionally, we've made the table page status pane more responsive to narrow viewports.

### 🗄️ Expanded database options on the home page

Database management options like disconnecting databases, editing connections, and reinstalling Mathesar schemas are now available on Mathesar's home page. Database cards also provide clearer feedback on the status of Mathesar's internal schemas when a database is disconnected.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

**End of support for PostgreSQL 13 and Python 3.9**

Mathesar 0.8.0 ends official support for PostgreSQL 13 and Python 3.9. We recommend upgrading these dependencies prior to installing 0.8.0 to ensure continued compatibility and support.

While Mathesar is likely to function with older versions, compatibility is no longer tested, and assistance cannot be provided for issues encountered on unsupported versions.

Mathesar 0.8.0 supports:

- **Python**: 3.10–3.13
- **PostgreSQL**: 14–18
