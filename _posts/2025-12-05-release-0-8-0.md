Mathesar 0.8.0 is here! This release introduces **related columns**, allowing you to view and edit data from related tables directly within a single table view. Related columns currently work with many-to-many relationships, perfect for use cases like movie genres or tagging systems.

This release also adds **nested filtering for complex queries** and the ability to **work with database views**.

Other highlights in this release:

- **🔗 Related columns:** View and edit related data across tables in a single view with an intuitive multi-tagger interface (currently supports many-to-many relationships).
- **🔍 Nested filtering:** Create complex queries with AND/OR/NOT logic and grouped filter conditions.
- **👁️ Database views support:** Views are now displayed in the schema page and can be distinguished from regular tables.
- **🔒 Configurable SSL:** Set SSL mode for database connections through the UI or environment variables.
- **📱 Better mobile support:** Improved experience on phones and tablets with touch-optimized interactions.
- **✂️ Copy and paste in context menu:** Copy and paste operations are now available directly from cell context menus.

And of course, many other fixes and enhancements. Read [our full release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.8.0/) for more information.

### 🔗 Related columns

Mathesar now supports displaying and editing related columns, allowing you to view and edit data from related tables directly within a single table view. Currently, this feature works with many-to-many relationships—perfect for use cases like assigning multiple genres to movies, tagging blog posts with categories, or managing any scenario where records need multiple associations.

You can add joined columns from related tables, making it easier to work with related data without switching between multiple views. Joined columns can be selected, resized, and edited just like regular columns. When working with related columns, you can use the new multi-tagger interface to select multiple related records through an intuitive checkbox-based interface with search and pagination support. This provides a seamless experience for managing relationships across your database.

### 🔍 More powerful filtering

Filters now support grouping conditions with AND/OR/NOT logic, enabling you to create complex queries. You can group multiple filter conditions together and combine groups to build sophisticated filtering expressions, such as finding records that match one set of criteria OR another set of criteria.

### 👁️ Database views support

Database views are now displayed in the schema page and can be distinguished from regular tables with a dedicated icon and tag. Views appear alongside tables in your schema navigation, making it easier to work with pre-defined queries and read-only datasets.

### 🔒 Configurable SSL mode for database connections

You can now configure SSL mode when connecting to external databases through the Mathesar UI, and set SSL mode for internal database connections via environment variables. This provides better control over secure database connections and enables connections to databases that require SSL.

### 🔐 Column-level UPDATE privilege support

Mathesar now properly respects PostgreSQL's column-level UPDATE privileges. Users with column-level UPDATE permissions can now edit those specific columns, even if they don't have table-level UPDATE privileges. Previously, users with only column-level permissions were blocked from editing entirely.

### ✂️ Copy and paste in context menu

Copy and paste operations are now available directly from the cell context menu, making these features more discoverable and accessible, especially on touch-only devices where keyboard shortcuts may not be available.

### 📱 Better support for phones and tablets

Mathesar now works better on mobile devices and tablets. Touch-only devices have improved support for selecting multiple cells through a new context menu option that lets you enter a cell selection mode. The table page status pane also responds better to narrow viewports, improving the experience when using Mathesar on smaller screens or in split-screen configurations.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

**End of support for PostgreSQL 13 and Python 3.9**

Mathesar 0.8.0 ends official support for PostgreSQL 13 and Python 3.9. We recommend upgrading these dependencies prior to installing 0.8.0 to ensure continued compatibility and support.

While Mathesar is likely to function with older versions, compatibility is no longer tested, and assistance cannot be provided for issues encountered on unsupported versions.

Mathesar 0.8.0 supports:

- **Python**: 3.10–3.13
- **PostgreSQL**: 14–18
