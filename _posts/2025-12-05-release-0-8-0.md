Mathesar 0.8.0 is here! This release makes it easier to work with connected data by introducing **related columns**. You can now extend a table to show columns from related tables directly in the table page. This release also adds **nested filtering for more complex queries** and support for **working with database views**.

Additional improvements include configurable SSL for database connections and an improved experience on phones and tablets.

Other highlights in this release:

- **🔍 Nested filtering:** Create complex queries with AND/OR/NOT logic and grouped filter conditions.
- **👁️ Database views support:** Views are now displayed in the schema page and can be distinguished from regular tables.
- **🔒 Configurable SSL:** Set SSL mode for database connections through the UI or environment variables.
- **📱 Better mobile support:** Improved experience on phones and tablets with touch-optimized interactions.
- **✂️ Copy and paste in context menu:** Copy and paste operations are now available directly from cell context menus.

And of course, many other fixes and enhancements. Read [our full release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.8.0/) for more information.

### 🔗 Extend tables with Related columns

Use the "Extend" button to display columns from related tables into your current table view. After displaying the columns, you can edit them by adding or removing values. You'll see a dropdown of available choices with checkboxes to add or remove them from the record.

This feature currently only supports "many to many" relationships, like `genres` related to `movies` via a `movies_genres` table, or `categories` applied to `support_tickets` via a `ticket_categories` table.

### 🔍 More powerful filtering

![Complex nested filters with AND/OR groups](/images/blog/0.8.0/complex-filters.png)

Filters now support nested groups with AND, OR, and NOT logic, allowing you to build more expressive and flexible queries. You can group related conditions together and then combine those groups to find records that match one set of criteria or another.

### 👁️ Database views support

Database views now appear in Mathesar alongside tables. Views are clearly labeled with an icon and blue color so you can distinguish them from editable tables, while still navigating and inspecting view data inside of Mathesar.

### 🔒 Configurable SSL mode for database connections

You can now choose an SSL mode when connecting to external databases in the Mathesar UI. You can also set the SSL mode for internal database connections via environment variables. This improves compatibility with databases that require SSL and gives you more control over how connections are secured.

### 🔐 Column-level UPDATE privilege support

Mathesar now respects PostgreSQL's column-level UPDATE privileges. If your database permissions allow updates to only certain columns, you can edit those columns in Mathesar even if you don't have table-level UPDATE privileges.

### ✂️ Copy and paste in context menu

![Copy and paste options in the cell context menu](/images/blog/0.8.0/copy-in-context-menu.png)

Copy and paste are now available directly from the cell context menu. This makes the features easier to discover, and it's especially helpful on touch-only devices where keyboard shortcuts aren't available.

### 📱 Better support for phones and tablets

On touch-only devices, you can select multiple cells using a new context menu option that enters a dedicated selection mode. Additionally, the table page status pane now adapts better to narrow viewports, improving the experience on small screens and in split-screen layouts.

### 🗄️ Manage databases from the home page

You can now disconnect databases, edit their connections, and reinstall Mathesar schemas from Mathesar's home page. Database cards also provide clearer feedback when a database disconnects, indicating if Mathesar was able to uninstall Mathesar schemas or not.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

**End of support for PostgreSQL 13 and Python 3.9**

Mathesar 0.8.0 ends official support for PostgreSQL 13 and Python 3.9. We recommend upgrading these dependencies prior to installing 0.8.0 to ensure continued compatibility and support.

While Mathesar is likely to function with older versions, compatibility is no longer tested, and assistance cannot be provided for issues encountered on unsupported versions.

Mathesar 0.8.0 supports:

- **Python**: 3.10–3.13
- **PostgreSQL**: 14–18
