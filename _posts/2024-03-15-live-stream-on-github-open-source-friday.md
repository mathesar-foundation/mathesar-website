Today I had the pleasure of joining GitHub's Open Source Friday live stream to talk about Mathesar with Kedasha Kerr, Developer Advocate from GitHub.

Watch the full 45 minute interview below:

The live demo was a fun way to weave together many of Mathesar's latest features and see them in action. Afterwards, Kedasha and the audience had some great questions â€” and even some helpful tips! I always love when someone asks me, _"why Svelte instead of React?"_ I probably could have done a whole interview just on that topic!

The sample data featured in the video is available for anyone to play with on our [live demo](https://demo.mathesar.org/).

Many thanks to Kedasha for hosting!
