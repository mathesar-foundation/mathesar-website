We’re excited to introduce [**Mathesar 0.2.1**](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.2.1/)! This release addresses key user feedback from our initial beta release last month, focusing on **improving usability, customization, and database management**.

Please see our **[release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.2.1/)** for all of the changes and instructions on how to upgrade, but here are some highlights of what's new:

### Database Nicknames

Managing multiple database connections just got much easier. Users can now assign **nicknames** to their configured databases, making it simpler to differentiate between them.

This feature is especially helpful when dealing with similarly named databases or external connections with auto-generated names.

In addition to nickname support, all database connection values can now be edited.

### In-App Feedback

We've added an **in-app feedback form** to let users share thoughts, report issues, or suggest improvements **without leaving Mathesar**.

Your feedback helps us make Mathesar better—send us your thoughts directly from within the app!

### Persisted Column Widths

Column widths in table views are now **automatically saved** between sessions. Users no longer need to manually resize columns every time they revisit a table.

### Schema Deletion with Safety

Mathesar now **drops all objects within a schema before deleting the schema itself**, but **without relying on CASCADE**. This ensures a controlled deletion process, preventing unintended removal of external dependencies while still allowing schema cleanup.

This improvement provides a **unique balance between safety and convenience**, making it easier to manage schemas confidently.

### PostgreSQL 17 for Docker Compose Installs

New Mathesar installations using **Docker Compose** now default to **PostgreSQL 17**. If you’re upgrading an existing Mathesar installation, [check our upgrade guide](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.2.1#upgrade-postgres) to transition safely.

### Support for Passwordless Database Connections

Mathesar now allows database connections **without requiring a password**, enabling support for secure, passwordless authentication mechanisms.
