Mathesar 0.3.0 introduces several major improvements to Mathesar's installation experience, look-and-feel, usability, and stability.

Highlights include a refreshed visual design in light mode, a new dark mode, and a new one-line script install method. We’ve also improved usability of the Data Explorer, finding table records, and creating records. The release includes several other smaller fixes and improvements.

Please see the [0.3.0 release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.3.0/) for the full list of changes and upgrade instructions.

### A new look, with dark mode

Mathesar now features a modernized visual style that improves contrast, consistency, and readability. As part of our new look, we’ve also introduced a dark mode theme for users who prefer using dark backgrounds to reduce eye strain for extended use.

By default, Mathesar will respect your "system" color theme. You can switch to explicitly using light or dark mode via a new toggle in the header menu:

### Simplified standalone install method

Installing Mathesar without Docker is now much easier. We've introduced a single install script that handles both new installs and upgrades. It uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) under the hood to manage Python dependencies and streamline setup.

See our [install guide](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/administration/install-from-scratch/) for details.

### Improved record selection

Previously limited to 10 rows, Mathesar’s record selector now supports pagination, showing up to 100 records per page. This makes browsing records much easier, especially in large tables.

### Better Data Explorer experience

We’ve unified the exploration editing and viewing experience into a single, more intuitive interface. Column widths are now saved automatically, and small UI improvements make the tool easier to use overall.

### Pasting into draft rows

You can now paste data directly into rows that haven't yet been saved. This makes data entry much smoother and more forgiving.

### Other fixes and improvements

- Initial security policy added
- Better help text for Postgres `WITH TIME ZONE` option
- Bug fixes for `NOT NULL` constraints, localization, UUID filtering, and more
- Ongoing backend and frontend maintenance for future feature work
