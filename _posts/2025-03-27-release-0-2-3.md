Weâ€™re excited to introduce [**Mathesar 0.2.3**](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.2.3/)! This release improves primary key handling, adds a new UUID type, and adds paste support to streamline data editing. There are also a number of small bug fixes and improvements.

Please see our **[release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.2.3/)** for all of the changes and instructions on how to upgrade. Here are some highlights of what's new:

---

### More options for internal database connections

Mathesar now supports connecting to internal PostgreSQL databases using any valid connection string, including configurations that:

- Use Unix sockets instead of TCP/IP.
- Omit the port or do not require a password.

Previously, Mathesar required both a port and password to be defined, which prevented these types of connections. This was a common pain point for users attempting to use custom Postgres installations.

Here's an example of the `docker-compose.yml` configuration to connect to Postgres running on the UNIX socket:

```yml
POSTGRES_HOST="%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fpostgresql"
POSTGRES_PORT=""
POSTGRES_USER="mathesar"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""
POSTGRES_DB="mathesar_django"
```

**Tip:** `%2F` is the URL-encoded version of `/`, which is required when specifying a Unix socket path in a PostgreSQL connection string.

### "Duplicate row" functionality

It's now easy to duplicate rows in Mathesar using the "right click" context menu. Right click any cell in the row you would like to duplicate and choose "Duplicate Record".

### Support for pasting into cells of newly-inserted rows

You may now paste data into the cells of newly-saved rows. Previously, you needed to hit the "refresh" button or reload the page before pasting into these rows.

It is still not possible to paste into new, _unsaved_ rows. Attempting to do so will present an error:

<!-- (Use this section to list any incremental work done on still-incomplete changes) -->

### Improved inference for numeric columns

In this release we have greatly improved the accuracy, safety, and performance of type inference for numeric columns. This means that Mathesar is much faster and reliable at detecting the type of numeric columns.

In the future, this will enable significant front end performance improvements when switching columns to and from numeric types.

## We _need_ your feedback!

It's still early days for Mathesar's beta and we're aiming to increase our production usage. We would really appreciate it if you could try this release and **share your thoughts on how Mathesar is working for you**.

If you have 20 minutes, please **[schedule a call using this link](https://cal.com/mathesar/users)** - we're happy to offer you a $25 gift card for your time.
