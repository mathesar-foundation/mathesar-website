Mathesar 0.6.0 is here! Our biggest new feature is the **file data type**, which allows you to upload, download, and preview files alongside your data. This release also brings a refreshed visual style with semantic colors that make it easier to distinguish between databases, schemas, tables, and more at a glance.

Other highlights in this release:

- **ðŸŽ¨ Refreshed visual style:** Semantic colors help you quickly understand and navigate your data.
- **âš¡ Performance improvements:** Updated default Gunicorn sync worker count for better multi-user performance.

And of course, many other fixes and enhancements. Read [our full release notes](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/releases/0.6.0/) for more information.

### ðŸ“Ž File data type

Mathesar now includes a file data type, which lets you attach and interact with files directly in your tables. Any file type can be stored, with images showing a thumbnail preview that can be expanded to a larger view. Other file types display an icon with file details. Files can be downloaded or removed from a row at any time.

To use file columns, you'll first need to [configure an S3-compatible storage backend](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/administration/file-backend-config/). Once configured, you can add files just like any other data type, and then upload files through the Mathesar interface.

### ðŸŽ¨ Refreshed visual style with semantic colors

Mathesar's interface now uses semantic colors to help you quickly understand and navigate your data. Databases, schemas, tables, and other objects each have distinct colors, making it easier to tell them apart at a glance. This update brings a clearer, more consistent visual style across the application, improving readability and reducing the cognitive load when working with complex datasets.

### âš¡ Performance improvements

Mathesar now sets the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` variable to `3` by default, which can significantly improve performance for installs with multiple users. Existing users should update their configuration using our [recommended settings](https://docs.mathesar.org/latest/administration/environment-variables/#web_concurrency).
