### Sample data is loaded more quickly

Mathesar [0.1.4](https://docs.mathesar.org/releases/0.1.4/) added the ability to load sample data when creating a new database. We've made some performance improvements in this release that significantly speed up that process. This also fixed a bug where adding a new database was timing out in some installation setups.

### The connections page is not as wide

The database connections page now has a maximum width, making it easier to read on larger screens.
