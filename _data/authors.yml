    "I'm using a database (and planning to use Mathesar) to store and analyze
    info I collect about various countries. e.g. cost of living, tax rates, population
    statistics, economic statistics, etc. I'm tentatively calling it the **Country Comparator**."

    "My husband and I use a database-backed application to **track movies**. Movies
    we own, movies we want to watch, movies we’ve watched. I had to write a bunch
    of code for it, but it would have been much faster to build it using Mathesar –
    if it had existed!"
