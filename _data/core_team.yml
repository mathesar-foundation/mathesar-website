    "My husband and I use a database-backed application to **track movies**. Movies we own, movies we want to watch, movies we’ve watched.
    
    I had to write a bunch of code for it, but it would have been much faster to build it using Mathesar – if it had existed!"

    "I have an older relative who has been compiling **family genealogy** data for years through an arduous process of paper forms in the mail. I'd like to digitize it for future generations! Spreadsheets are a poor fit because of the data's highly relational nature. And the family wants to maintain privacy, making existing solutions unappealing.
    
    With Mathesar, our family will eventually be able to collaboratively manage this data and visualize it in new and exciting ways!"

    "As someone who really enjoys cooking at home, I'm thinking Mathesar would be a great for **storing all my recipes** in one place. Being able to search and filter my recipes based on ingredients and cooking time would be really cool. I'm excited to give it a try!"

    "I intend to use a database to maintain a **personal diary**, but with data tracking!

    I'll be logging my daily life: my anime watching habits, exercise routine, work progress, social interactions etc.,
    I can analyze this data to gain valuable insights into my own behavior and lifestyle.
    
    Mathesar is going to make all of this a breeze!"

    "I'm using a database (and planning to use Mathesar) to store and analyze info I collect about various countries. e.g. cost of living, tax rates, population statistics, economic statistics, etc.
    
    I'm tentatively calling it the **Country Comparator**."

    "I'm using a database to enable people to make better choices about which credit card to get. In the current market, credit card benefits, eligibility requirements, etc. frequently change. Mathesar allows me to make these frequent changes quickly and without much hassle and share the updated data easily."
